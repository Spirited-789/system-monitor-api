# üñ•Ô∏è System Resource Monitor API

A lightweight FastAPI-based service to monitor system resources like CPU, memory, and disk usage. The API exposes real-time system metrics and integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for observability. Built with Docker, deployed via GitHub Actions.

---

## üöÄ Features

- `/status` endpoint for JSON-formatted system stats
- `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Dockerized app with Prometheus & Grafana stack

---

## üìå Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose

---

## üìÇ Endpoints

### `GET /status`

Returns JSON response with:
- CPU usage (%)
- Memory usage (%)
- Disk usage (%)

### `GET /metrics`

Exposes metrics in Prometheus-compatible format for automatic scraping.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-monitor-api
cd system-monitor-api
```

### 2. Run Locally (without Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build

- Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (Default login: `admin` / `admin`)

### 4. Add GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repo:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### Trigger:
- Runs on every `push` to `main`

### Steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies & run unit tests
3. Build Docker image
4. Log in to Docker Hub (via GitHub Secrets)
5. Push image to Docker Hub
